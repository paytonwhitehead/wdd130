        <p>Hello, my name is Payton Whitehead I am twenty five years old. I am married to a beautiful Canadian named Eden, we have been married for just over a year. We have a dog named Rupert, he is one of our very best friends and a very good boy. I have lived in Utah my whole life, so I guess I must be pretty fond of it. Both my wife and I served missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, she served in Toronto Canada and I served in Minneapolis Minnesota. Having served in Minnesota I was prepared for the cold of Canada I can happily say. I am excited for this class because ever since I came home from my mission my growth has been a little stunted, from working one dead end job to another. This class has not only given me hope about my future but has also brought the joy of learning a new subject back into my life. Well that's a little about me me, thank you for taking the time to read all this. I hope that you can take something from me, and I am excited to see where these seven weeks will take me.</p>

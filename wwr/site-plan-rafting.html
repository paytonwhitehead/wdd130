            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>We aim to give the experience of a lifetime. Here at Lazy Rivers Rafting Co. we offer stunning sites, extreme fishing, and unforgettable fun, all at small fortune prices. Don't break the bank on somewhere lame like "Disneypark", come spend that fortune at the one stop rafting shop and company that is sure to leave you with a story to tell all your loved ones.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Who is our Target audience? Here at Lazy Rivers Rafting Co. We aim to please are customers, our customers are lifetime rich or have just barely come into money. We hope to target people in the late 20's to early 60's, as a rafting company we don't want any large lawsuits on our hands from an elderly person just happening to break their already worn down hips or something similiar. We are targeting the people of that age group who enjoy the outdoors and want to get away from the technology dependant world. We don't care about experience level because we offer many different locations and rivers of all difficulties. We hope a large number of people will also enjoy trophy fishing as we offer that as well. We own all the land that these rivers run through and have privately stocked them with trophy fish of all kinds. We also offer breath taking scenery for the people who seek to see the sights of the world that are of envy.</p>
                <p>What do our Customers normally want? Well they want the experience of the lifetime, something they can flaunt over their family and friends heads for a lifetime. Weither it be catching their dream exotic fish, or seeing the beauty of the untamed wild, here at Lazy Rivers Rafting Co. we promise that our customers will be able to achieve their dreams, and that they will be able to tell of their experience to the envy of the world.</p>
                <p>What are the needs of our customers that aren't being met? We do not offer our customers travel to our destinations, it is up to them how they wish to come to us. We unfortunately do not at this time have a landing pad for helicopters. We do not have a private landing strip either so our customers will sadly have to use nearby facilaties, but we are aiming on purchasing said items in the future. We do not have super readily availble medical care, customers will have to sign a waiver with the understanding that we are a rafting company, injuries may and have happened. We don't have our own private medical staff. Our staff is trained in first aid, but our experience is that of the outdoors so if injuries do happen customers will have to be transported to nearby care.</p>
                <p>What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website? Our customers may have questions on the locations that we offer excursions, they may also wonder how much trips will cost, and finally they might be asking what meals are offered on these trips. The answer to this is difficult as all trips are customizable, we have a number of locations, our meal plans are customizable due to do our private chef's traveling with our customers are able to make a number of things and the customers will be able to plan what meals they want along the trip. For the more fisherman friendly customers our chef's will also a delicious meal based on the catch of the day. So for this reason we have fluctuating prices because it depends on the location the customer wants to go, the duration of their stay and the meals which they choose. We do have a base price for our more penny pinching customers that offers a default trip legnth and meal plan with limited experience, but it is a plan that is their nonetheless.</p>
                <p>How will my audience usually access my desktop? Well where our customers are so wealthy we hope to optimize our site so that it works well across all sites, but with that in mind we will focus to make things optimal for the cellphone user because we want our customers to be able to accesss our site anywhere at anytime.</p>
